# TheFoodies

**TheFoodies** is a project focused on graph-based data exploration and analysis of cooking recipes. It aims to represent and study the relationships between recipes, ingredients, and user interactions using graph structures.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to explore the underlying structure of culinary data using graph techniques, in order to better understand user preferences, similarities between recipes, and culinary trends.

2. Extract the contents of the dataset into a folder named **`archive/`** at the root of the project.

## Project Structure

- `main.ipynb` â€“ Main notebook for loading, processing, and visualizing recipe data using graphs.
- `archive/` â€“ Directory containing the `.csv` files extracted from the Kaggle dataset.
- `requirements.txt` *(optional)* â€“ List of required Python packages for running the notebook.

## Usage
